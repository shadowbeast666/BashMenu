# BashMenu
Simple script created to pass the subject. 
Script has one main menu from which you can go to other sub-menus from which we can choose the functions that the user is interested in.
The main task of the script is to set up CRON Jobs that will allow us to automate our work.
The script allows us to set a notification whether a given host or webservice is active. I also added some network statistics needed to diagnose the problems.
The script includes things like:
- manipulation of users and groups
- displaying computer statistics (RAM, CPU, network)
- manipulation of CRON Jobs
- Script is protected against invalid input from the user.
